## Part 1: Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm in a Static Environment
### Task 1 Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm:

</p>
    After 100 iterations, 10k steps, for each convergence rate:
     -Epsilon of 0.4 converges the fastest but with the worst average reward of about 7
     -Epsilon of 0.1 converges second fastest but not quite with the highest reward, it stabilizes at around 11 Average reward
     -Epsilon of 0.05 converges third fastest but at the highest average reward of around 13
     -Epsilon of 0.01 converges slowly but eventually surpasses all but e=0.05
     
    Overall e=0.05 seems optimal, it converges slightly slower than e=0.1but gets a much higher reward than all others, if quick convergence is valued more, then e=0.1 would be optimal.

### Task 2 Thompson Sampling Algorithm:

</p>
    After many iterations and steps, Thompson Sampling converged the fastest (besides e=.4 but that has a terrible average reward) and had a high average reward, only beat out by e=0.05 when that converged afterwards.
